Overview:
This is a simple banking simulation game built in Python. It allows users to:

- Deposit money into their account.
- Withdraw money from their account.
- Check their account balance.
- Exit the game.
- The game runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, providing a basic interface to interact with their bank account.

Features:
- Deposit money: Add funds to your bank account.
- Withdraw money: Remove funds from your account (if sufficient balance is available).
- Check balance: View the current balance in your account.
- User input validation: The game ensures valid numeric input for deposits and withdrawals.
- Interactive menu: A simple menu-driven interface to navigate the different actions.
